## 🚀 Quick Setup (Enterprise Mode)

<details>
<summary>Step 1: 🌐 Get Your Network Details (1 minute)</summary>

### Find Your Current IP
```bash
curl ifconfig.me
# Example output: 203.0.113.45
```

### Find Your Office Network (Optional)
**Ask your IT team for the office network CIDR, or use individual IPs:**

**Individual IPs (Simple):**
```hcl
admin_ip_whitelist = [
  "203.0.113.45/32",    # Your home IP
  "198.51.100.20/32",   # Colleague 1 IP  
  "192.0.2.100/32",     # Colleague 2 IP
]
```

**Office Network (Better):**
```hcl
admin_ip_whitelist = [
  "203.0.113.0/24",     # Entire office network
  "198.51.100.45/32",   # Your home IP
]
```

**✅ Copy your IPs** - you'll need them in Step 2!

</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 2: 🔧 Configure Enterprise Security (2 minutes)</summary>

### Open Your Configuration File
```bash
# Navigate to your terraform directory
cd TCA-InfraForge/terraform/oracle-hybrid

# Edit your configuration
# Use: nano, vim, VS Code, or any text editor
nano terraform.tfvars
```

### Add Enterprise Security Settings
**Add these lines to your `terraform.tfvars` file:**

```hcl
# ENTERPRISE SECURITY CONFIGURATION
security_mode = "enterprise"
enable_enterprise_security = true

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Replace with your actual IPs from Step 1
admin_ip_whitelist = [
  "203.0.113.45/32",    # Your IP - CHANGE THIS
  "198.51.100.0/24",    # Office network - CHANGE THIS  
]

# Password Security (automatic)
auto_generate_passwords = true
password_length = 32

# Enterprise Features  
enable_bastion_host = true
enable_security_monitoring = true
enable_audit_logging = true
enable_encrypted_backups = true
```

### Optional: Add SSL for Professional URLs
```hcl
# Professional HTTPS URLs (optional but recommended)
enable_automatic_ssl = true
domain_name = "infraforge.yourcompany.com"  # Your domain
ssl_email = "admin@yourcompany.com"         # For SSL notifications
```

**✅ Save the file** when done!

</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 3: 🚀 Deploy with Security (2 minutes)</summary>

### Deploy Your Secure Platform
```bash
# Apply the enterprise security configuration
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**⏳ This takes 3-5 minutes...**

**Expected Output:**
```
Apply complete! Resources: 15 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:
argocd_dashboard_url = "https://infraforge.company.com"  # With SSL!
generated_passwords = <sensitive>  # Secure 32-char passwords
security_status = "Enterprise mode enabled"
```

### Get Your Auto-Generated Passwords
```bash
# View the secure passwords (only you can see these)
terraform output -json generated_credentials
```

![Terraform Generated Passwords](./docs/screenshots/terraform-output-passwords.png)
*Secure 32-character passwords generated automatically for all services*

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "argocd_password": "Kj7$mN9#pL2@qR8*vX4&wZ1!eT6^yU3%",
  "gitea_password": "Fp4$nM7@rK9#sL2*wX6&vZ8!qT1^eY5%", 
  "grafana_password": "Wp9$mK4@nL7#pR2*sX5&wZ3!qT8^eU6%"
}
```

**✅ Success!** Your enterprise platform is secure and ready!

## 🛡️ Security Features Explained

<details>
<summary>🔐 Auto-Generated Passwords</summary>

### What Happens
- **32-character passwords** generated automatically
- **Unique per deployment** - never reused
- **Stored securely** in Terraform state (encrypted)
- **Special characters** included for maximum security

### How to Access
```bash
# View all passwords
terraform output -json generated_credentials

# View specific password
terraform output -raw generated_credentials | jq -r '.argocd_password'
```

### If You Lose Passwords
```bash
# Regenerate all passwords
terraform taint random_password.argocd_admin[0]
terraform taint random_password.gitea_admin[0]
terraform taint random_password.grafana_admin[0]
terraform apply
```

**🔒 Passwords are cryptographically secure and unique!**

</details>

<details>
<summary>🌐 IP Access Control</summary>

### How It Works
- **SSH access** restricted to your IP whitelist only
- **Admin interfaces** (ArgoCD, Grafana) restricted
- **Public services** (websites) remain accessible
- **Oracle Security Groups** enforce at network level

### Add New IPs
```hcl
# Edit terraform.tfvars
admin_ip_whitelist = [
  "203.0.113.45/32",    # Existing IP
  "192.0.2.100/32",     # New colleague IP - ADD THIS
]

# Apply changes
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### Emergency Access
```hcl
# Temporary: Allow your current IP
admin_ip_whitelist = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # ⚠️ TEMPORARY ONLY!

# Apply, fix your issue, then restore restrictions
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**🛡️ Network-level protection prevents unauthorized access!**

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔒 Bastion Host Security</summary>

### What Is a Bastion Host?
- **Secure jump box** for SSH access
- **Audit logging** of all SSH sessions  
- **Single point of entry** for administration
- **Separate from application servers**

### How to Use
```bash
# Connect to bastion host first
ssh ubuntu@BASTION_IP

# Then connect to application servers from bastion
ssh ubuntu@VM1_PRIVATE_IP  # ArgoCD server
ssh ubuntu@VM2_PRIVATE_IP  # Monitoring server
```

### View SSH Audit Logs
```bash
# On bastion host
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log  # SSH connections
sudo tail -f /var/log/audit.log # Admin actions
```

**🔐 All administrative access is logged and audited!**

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔍 Security Monitoring</summary>

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Failed login attempts** → Automatic IP blocking
- **Unusual resource usage** → Performance alerts
- **Container crashes** → Immediate notifications
- **Security events** → Slack/email alerts

## 🎯 Security Validation

<details>
<summary>✅ Security Checklist</summary>

### After Deployment, Verify:

#### Network Security
- [ ] **SSH restricted**: Try SSH from non-whitelisted IP (should fail)
- [ ] **Admin UIs protected**: Try ArgoCD from non-whitelisted IP (should fail)  
- [ ] **Public services work**: Website accessible from anywhere
- [ ] **SSL certificates**: HTTPS works without warnings

#### Authentication Security
- [ ] **Strong passwords**: 32+ characters with special chars
- [ ] **No default credentials**: Can't login with admin/admin
- [ ] **Session timeouts**: Admin sessions expire automatically
- [ ] **Multi-factor**: OIDC working (if configured)

#### Monitoring Security  
- [ ] **Audit logs working**: SSH connections logged
- [ ] **Security alerts**: Failed login attempts detected
- [ ] **Resource monitoring**: Unusual usage triggers alerts
- [ ] **Backup verification**: Daily backups completing

### Security Test Commands
```bash
# Test SSH restriction (should fail from non-whitelisted IP)
ssh ubuntu@VM_IP  # From non-office network

# Test admin UI restriction (should fail)
curl -I http://VM_IP:8080  # From non-office network

# Test audit logging (should show your connections)
ssh ubuntu@BASTION_IP
sudo grep "Accepted publickey" /var/log/auth.log
```

**✅ All checks should pass for full security!**

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

<details>
<summary>🔐 Team Access Management</summary>

### Adding New Team Members
1. **Get their IP address**: `curl ifconfig.me`
2. **Add to whitelist**: Update `admin_ip_whitelist` in terraform.tfvars
3. **Apply changes**: `terraform apply -auto-approve`
4. **Share credentials**: Send them the auto-generated passwords securely

### Removing Team Members
1. **Remove their IP**: Delete from `admin_ip_whitelist`
2. **Apply changes**: `terraform apply -auto-approve`
3. **Regenerate passwords**: If they had access to shared accounts

### Regular Security Reviews
- **Monthly**: Review IP whitelist, remove inactive users
- **Quarterly**: Regenerate all passwords
- **Annually**: Review audit logs, update security policies

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔄 Password Rotation</summary>

### Automatic Rotation (Recommended)
```hcl
# Add to terraform.tfvars for monthly rotation
password_rotation_days = 30

# Terraform will automatically regenerate passwords
```

### Manual Rotation
```bash
# Force regeneration of all passwords
terraform taint random_password.argocd_admin[0]
terraform taint random_password.gitea_admin[0] 
terraform taint random_password.grafana_admin[0]
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Get new passwords
terraform output -json generated_credentials
```

### Emergency Password Reset
```bash
# If passwords are compromised
terraform apply -replace="random_password.argocd_admin[0]"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>📊 Security Monitoring Setup</summary>

### Enable Slack Alerts
```hcl
# Add to terraform.tfvars
security_alert_webhook = "YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"

# Types of alerts you'll receive:
# - Failed login attempts (>5 in 10 minutes)
# - Unusual resource usage (>90% CPU/memory)
# - Container crashes or restarts
# - SSH connections from new IPs
# - Certificate expiration warnings
```

### Custom Monitoring Rules
```hcl
# Add custom security rules
custom_security_rules = [
  {
    name = "Multiple failed logins"
    condition = "failed_logins > 10"
    action = "block_ip_for_1hour" 
  },
  {
    name = "High CPU usage"
    condition = "cpu_usage > 95%"
    action = "send_alert"
  }
]
```
